<p> In this project there are three type of users: agents, users, and owners. Owners can register to the system, load the information
of their homes, and request to an agent to sell the homes. Users can search the places in a
specific area, to buy or rent. They can follow a specific area to be informed about new places
added to system. Agents and owners are also users, which means they can do usersâ€™ stuff in
the system like searching, following etc. There are many attributes a home can have such as
neighborhood crime, pet allowance, etc. Users can send messages to agents, request to
visit the place. Also they can start a discussion about a neighborhood to ask other people
their opinions. Of course, the discussions can be commented with like and dislike options for
others. You can look at Trulia to develop your ideas.</p>
